              I'm a Computer Science student at UNSW, and my goal is to become a unicorn developer.
              But what does this mean? I want to be really good at both designing beautiful user
              interfaces and bringing them to life through frontend development. I believe in
              creating digital solutions that are not only functional but also user-friendly and
              visually appealing. I'm all about making technology more human-centric and sharing my
              fascination towards technology to everyone.

            In mid-2022, my friend and I decided to launch our very own podcast for the modern
            Australian-Asian. We found that in Australia, there is little representation for asians
            in the media, and we wanted to provide a platform to talk about anything we were
            passionate about as well as experiences/topics that were both common/avoided across
            Asian-Australian households. Here's our latest (and my personal favourite) episode:

            I love delving into the world of video editing, where I can bring together visuals,
            sounds, and narratives to create captivating and engaging stories that leave a lasting
            impact. Not only this, but romanticising my life and recording its moments makes me feel
            like I am living in a movie - a movie that can be relived through camera roll videos and
            personal edits:

            Photography quickly became a cherished hobby when I first got my hands on an iPod with a
            camera. Capturing landscapes and scenic views sparked my excitement, driving me to
            invest in a Sony a7III. I enjoy immersing myself in exploring scenic landscapes,
            freezing moments and sharing them with others. So here's me sharing to you some of my
            favourite photos while travelling:
